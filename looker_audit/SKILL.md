# Looker Audit & Health Check

This skill guides you through auditing a Looker instance using `looker-cli` and System Activity to identify performance bottlenecks, governance gaps, and cleanup opportunities. It flags the violation of best practices and suggests optimal fixes e.g. code snippets or step-by-step guide. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## ⚠️ Rules of Engagement (CRITICAL)
> 1. **Strictly API/CLI Only**: All auditing MUST be done via `looker-cli` or System Activity API calls.
> 2. **NO Filesystem Exploration**: Do **NOT** use `find`, `grep`, `ls`, `code_search`, or `find_by_name` to search the local filesystem. You are already in the correct environment. Assume `looker-cli` is ready.
> 3. **Immediate Action**: Run your first `looker-cli` command in **Step 1**. Do not waste turns exploring directory structures or reading files.
> 4. **Trust the API**: If a query returns empty or an error (e.g., connection failed), report that result. Do **NOT** attempt to "fix" it by scanning LookML files or searching the disk.
> 5. **No Custom Pipelines**: Use the provided inline query examples directly. Do **NOT** write Python scripts or complex pipelines to inventory fields or analyze data if a single query can do it.


# 🔁 Execution Workflow

Follow this three-tiered audit strategy to move from symptoms to structural root causes: 

1. **High-level Health audits**: Use Pulse/Vacuum commands for a broad, fast initial assessment (e.g., "Is the instance healthy? What are the top 5 slow things?").
2. **Drill-down review**: Use System Activity Inline Queries (refer to audit checklist below) for deep drill-downs, specific timeframes (e.g., 90 days vs 7 days), or custom filtering (e.g., filtering by a specific user or custom thresholds).
3. **Root-Cause Telemetry over Static Metrics**: Do not simply flag an issue. When a bottleneck is identified, immediately trace the root cause by cross-referencing relevant areas and identify what is causing latencies or failures (e.g. tile bloat, un-cached Explores, or missing required partition filters) to help guide developers to fix the underlying LookML.



## ⚡ High-level Health Audits
Before running detailed custom queries, you can use pre-packaged `looker-cli health` commands for a rapid overview of instance health. These are often faster than inline queries for a quick pulse check.

- **Dashboard Performance**: Find dashboards with queries slower than 30 seconds in the last 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse dashboard-performance
  ```
- **Dashboard Errors**: Check for dashboards with erroring queries in the last 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse dashboard-errors
  ```
- **Slow Explores**: Identify the slowest explores in the past 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse explore-performance
  ```
- **Schedule Failures**: Quick check for failing schedules.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse schedule-failures
  ```
- **Database Connections**: Verify connection status and query volume. Look for high latency (> 5 seconds), large result sets (> 1M rows), or stale tests.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse db-connections
  ```


## 📋 Audit Checklist

### 1. Dashboard Health & Complexity
Excessive complexity on dashboards leads to browser lag and poor user experience. Look for dashboards with > 20 tiles or average query times > 30 seconds.

- **Auto-Refresh**: Identify dashboards running unnecessary constant queries.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","dashboard.refresh_interval"],"filters":{"dashboard.refresh_interval":"-NULL"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Dynamic Fields**: Excessive dynamic fields (Table Calculations, Custom Fields) bypass LookML governance and strain browser memory.
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT scan LookML files for these; they are defined at the dashboard/tile level. You **MUST** use this **System Activity Inline Query** exclusively.
  - **Concern Thresholds**: > 3 per tile, > 10 per dashboard.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","query.count_of_dynamic_fields"],"filters":{"query.count_of_dynamic_fields":">3"},"sorts":["query.count_of_dynamic_fields desc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Merged Queries**: Merged queries bypass LookML joins and can be slow. Identify usage in the last 30 days.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"history","fields":["history.created_time","user.name","result_maker.merge_query_id","dashboard.title"],"filters":{"result_maker.is_merge_query":"Yes","history.created_date":"30 days"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Dashboard Average Runtime**: Drill down into average runtime beyond the Pulse command.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard_performance","fields":["dashboard.title","dashboard_history_stats.avg_runtime"],"sorts":["dashboard_history_stats.avg_runtime desc"],"limit":"10"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

### 2. Unused LookML Components (Last 90 Days)
Clean up debt by removing components that aren't being used. Consider Explores/Fields with 0 usage, or Models with very low usage (< 10 queries).

- **Workflow**: Rely **exclusively** on System Activity for identifying usage. Do **NOT** scan LookML files to verify usage history.

- **Unused Fields**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"field_usage","fields":["field_usage.model","field_usage.explore","field_usage.field"],"filters":{"field_usage.times_used":"0"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Unused/Low Usage Explores**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"history","fields":["query.model","query.view","history.query_run_count"],"filters":{"history.created_date":"90 days"},"sorts":["history.query_run_count asc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Unused Joins**: Deduce by finding Views with 0 field usage in an Explore.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"field_usage","fields":["field_usage.explore","field_usage.view","field_usage.times_used"],"filters":{"field_usage.times_used":"0"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Alternative: CLI Vacuum**: You can also use `looker-cli health vacuum explores` or `looker-cli health vacuum models` to identify unused components directly via the CLI. This can be more convenient than custom inline queries, though it may take longer to execute on large instances.

### 3. Pipeline & Cache Health

Ensure data is moving and caching efficiently. Check for stale data (models where max build time is older than DB's max update time).

- **Failed Datagroups**:
  - **Workflow**: First, check the operational status via the API. If failures are found, **then** inspect the LookML definition to suggest fixes. Do NOT scan LookML files to find failures.
  ```bash
  looker-cli api datagroup all_datagroups | jq '.[] | select(.trigger_error != null) | {name: .name, model: .model_name, error: .trigger_error}'
  ```
- **Failed PDTs**:
  - **Workflow**: Check the **operational status** via System Activity first. Only inspect LookML definitions when specific failures are identified to suggest fixes (e.g., syntax errors in SQL).
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"pdt_event_log","fields":["pdt_event_log.view_name","pdt_event_log.model_name","pdt_event_log.action","pdt_event_log.error_reason","pdt_event_log.created_time"],"filters":{"pdt_event_log.action":"%error%","pdt_event_log.created_date":"24 hours"},"sorts":["pdt_event_log.created_time desc"]}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```
- **Cache Efficiency (Cache Hits vs Live Queries)**: Check the ratio of cache hits. Target > 50% for standard dashboards.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"history","fields":["history.result_source","history.query_run_count"],"pivots":["history.result_source"],"filters":{"history.result_source":"-NULL","history.created_date":"30 days"},"sorts":["history.result_source"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

### 4. User, Content, and Schedule Management
Audit the instance for inactive assets, orphaned schedules, and schedule hotspots using System Activity. Look for high-volume schedules (> 1/hr) or stale schedules (not run in 30 days).

- **Inactive Accounts (No Login in 90 Days)**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"user","fields":["user.id","user.name","user.email","user.last_login_date"],"filters":{"user.last_login_date":"before 90 days ago"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

- **Inactive Content (Dashboards Not Queried in 90 Days)**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","dashboard.created_date"],"filters":{"history.query_run_count":"0","dashboard.created_date":"before 90 days ago"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

- **Schedule Hotspots (Peak Hours)**: Identify hours of the day with excessive scheduled jobs.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_job","fields":["scheduled_job.created_hour_of_day","scheduled_job.count"],"sorts":["scheduled_job.count desc"],"limit":"24"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

- **Failing Schedules**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_job","fields":["scheduled_job.id","scheduled_plan.name","scheduled_job.status","scheduled_job.status_detail"],"filters":{"scheduled_job.status":"failure"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

- **Orphaned Schedules (Owner is Disabled)**:
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_plan.id","scheduled_plan.name","user.name"],"filters":{"user.is_disabled":"Yes"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Definition-Based Analysis via CLI**: You can also use `looker-cli api scheduledplan all_scheduled_plans` to inspect schedule definitions directly. This is useful for analyzing `crontab` patterns to detect hotspots or checking `user_id` to identify potentially orphaned schedules (cross-reference with disabled users). However, to check **historical failures or execution history**, you MUST use the System Activity `scheduled_job` queries above.


## 🛡️ Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Piping JSON**: Always use `echo '...' | looker-cli ... json -` to pass inline JSON to `run_inline_query`. Do NOT pass the JSON string directly as an argument, or you will get a "file name too long" error.
- **Filter Wildcards**: Use `%` (SQL style) instead of `*` for string filters in `run_inline_query` on System Activity (e.g., `%error%`).
- **Timeframes**: The `history` table is time-bound. A field or explore showing as "unused" in 90 days might still be used for annual reporting. Verify before deleting.
- **Hidden Fields**: `hidden: yes` fields might still be used in joins or calculations. Do not delete without checking dependencies.
- **Unused Fields**: fields identified as not used might still be used in other explores via hub & spoke model. Check if the fields are being referenced via `extends` or `refinements` in spoke repositories.
- **Holistic Review**: You must analyze the instance or repositories as a whole to provide a holistic review.
- **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: NEVER hallucinate or assume data. Always run the query first and report only the actual results. If no data matches, report that explicitly.
