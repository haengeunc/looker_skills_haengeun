# Looker Audit & Health Check

This skill guides you through auditing a Looker instance using `looker-cli` and System Activity to identify performance bottlenecks, governance gaps, and cleanup opportunities. It flags the violation of best practices and suggests optimal fixes e.g. code snippets or step-by-step guide. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## ⚠️ Rules of Engagement (CRITICAL)
> 1. **Strictly API/CLI Only**: All operational auditing MUST be done via `looker-cli` or System Activity.
> 2. **NO Local Filesystem Scans**: Do **NOT** use `find`, `grep`, `ls`, `code_search`, or `find_by_name` to search the local filesystem (e.g., `google3/`). You are auditing a remote/containerized instance.
> 3. **Immediate Action**: Run your first `looker-cli` or API command in **Step 1**. Do not waste turns exploring directories.
> 4. **File Paths and Content via API Only**: If you need to identify file paths, line numbers, or read file content, you **MUST** use `looker-cli api project all_project_files [project_id]` or `project_file`. Do **NOT** use local filesystem tools to find or read them.
>    - **Scaling Guardrail**: Before running loops over project files, you MUST check the total number of files. If the total number of view files exceeds **50**, you **MUST ask the user** to specify which projects or files should be prioritized. Do NOT proceed with exhaustive loops on large codebases without explicit user direction.
> 5. **Graceful Degradation**: If the API fails to return file paths or details (e.g., 404), **STOP**. Report the violation using the identifiers you have (View Name, Model Name, Dashboard ID). Do **NOT** pivot to local filesystem searches.
> 6. **No Custom Pipelines**: Use inline queries directly. Do **NOT** write Python scripts or pipelines.
> 7. **Comprehensive Checklist Coverage**: You **MUST** execute queries and review **ALL** sections defined in the **Audit Checklist**. Do NOT skip sections unless explicitly instructed by the user. Thoroughness is critical.


## 🔍 Step 0: Looker CLI Connection Verification
Before starting any audit, verify that you are connected and authenticated to the Looker instance.
```bash
looker-cli user me
```
If this command fails, you MUST stop and authenticate using the `authenticating-looker-cli` skill.


# 🔁 Execution Workflow

Follow this three-tiered audit strategy to move from symptoms to structural root causes: 

1. **High-level Health audits**: Use Pulse/Vacuum commands for a broad, fast initial assessment (e.g., "Is the instance healthy? What are the top 5 slow things?").
2. **Drill-down review**: Use System Activity Inline Queries (refer to audit checklist below) for deep drill-downs, specific timeframes (e.g., 90 days vs 7 days), or custom filtering (e.g., filtering by a specific user or custom thresholds).
   - **Actionable Transition**: If `pulse dashboard-performance` flags a slow dashboard, **THEN** use the **Dashboard Average Runtime** query to drill down.
3. **Root-Cause Telemetry over Static Metrics**: Do not simply flag an issue. When a bottleneck is identified, immediately trace the root cause by cross-referencing relevant areas and identify what is causing latencies or failures (e.g. tile bloat, un-cached Explores, or missing required partition filters) to help guide developers to fix the underlying LookML.
   - **Actionable Transition**: If average runtime is high, **THEN** check **Tile Bloat (Heavy Dashboards)**, **Dynamic Fields**, or **Merged Queries**.
   - **LookML Inspection**: If LookML issues are suspected, you **MUST** provide full paths to the files (discovered via API as per Rule 4).



## ⚡ High-level Health Audits
Before running detailed custom queries, you can use pre-packaged `looker-cli health` commands for a rapid overview of instance health. These are often faster than inline queries for a quick pulse check.

- **Dashboard Performance**: Find dashboards with queries slower than 30 seconds in the last 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse dashboard-performance
  ```
- **Dashboard Errors**: Check for dashboards with erroring queries in the last 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse dashboard-errors
  ```
- **Slow Explores**: Identify the slowest explores in the past 7 days.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse explore-performance
  ```
- **Schedule Failures**: Quick check for failing schedules.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse schedule-failures
  ```
- **Database Connections**: Verify connection status and query volume. Look for high latency (> 5 seconds), large result sets (> 1M rows), or stale tests.
  ```bash
  looker-cli health pulse db-connections
  ```


## 📋 Audit Checklist

> [!TIP]
> **Avoid Limit Truncation (CRITICAL)**: Many System Activity queries below use a `limit` to prevent excessive output. To get the **exact total count** for reporting, you **MUST** run a separate query selecting only the `count` measure (e.g., `user.count`) with the same filters, or count the results in bash/jq if applicable. Do NOT just report the number of rows returned if it matches the limit.


### 1. Dashboard and Looks Health & Complexity
Excessive complexity on dashboards leads to browser lag and poor user experience. Look for dashboards with > 20 tiles or average query times > 30 seconds.

- **Tile Bloat (Heavy Dashboards)**: Identify dashboards with excessive tiles (> 25).
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id"],"filters":{"dashboard_element.count":">25"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq 'length'
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","dashboard_element.count"],"filters":{"dashboard_element.count":">25"},"sorts":["dashboard_element.count desc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


- **Auto-Refresh**: Identify dashboards running unnecessary auto refresh.
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.count"],"filters":{"dashboard.refresh_interval_ordered":"NOT NULL","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.title","dashboard.refresh_interval_ordered","user.name","dashboard.id","dashboard_element.count","dashboard_element.count_text","dashboard_element.total_query_tiles"],"filters":{"dashboard.refresh_interval_ordered":"NOT NULL","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"},"sorts":["dashboard.refresh_interval_ordered"],"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```

- **Dynamic Fields**: Excessive dynamic fields (Table Calculations, Custom Fields) bypass LookML governance and strain browser memory.
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT scan LookML files for these; they are defined at the dashboard/tile level. You **MUST** use this **System Activity Inline Query** exclusively.
  - **Concern Thresholds**: > 2 per tile.
  - **Total Count of Dashboards**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id"],"filters":{"query.count_of_dynamic_fields":">2"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq 'length'
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","query.count_of_dynamic_fields"],"filters":{"query.count_of_dynamic_fields":">2"},"sorts":["query.count_of_dynamic_fields desc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```

- **Merged Queries**: Merged queries bypass LookML joins and can be slow. Identify dashboards and Looks currently using them.
  - **Total Count of Dashboards**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.count"],"filters":{"result_maker.is_merge_query":"Yes","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title","dashboard_element.id","result_maker.merge_query_id"],"filters":{"result_maker.is_merge_query":"Yes","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```

- **Dashboard Average Runtime**: Drill down into average runtime of top 10 dashboards to investigate dashboard's latency.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard_performance","fields":["dashboard.title","dashboard_history_stats.avg_runtime"],"sorts":["dashboard_history_stats.avg_runtime desc"],"limit":"10"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

### 2. Query Performance
Identify slow queries across Explores, Dashboards, and Looks to pinpoint optimization targets.

- **Slow Queries (Last 30 Days)**: Find queries taking longer than 10 seconds.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"history","fields":["history.created_time","history.source","history.runtime","query.model","query.view","user.name"],"filters":{"history.runtime":">10","history.created_date":"30 days","history.source":"explore,dashboard,look"},"sorts":["history.runtime desc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

### 3. Pipeline & Cache Health

Ensure data is moving and caching efficiently. Check for stale data (models where max build time is older than DB's max update time).

- **Failed Datagroups**:
  - **Workflow**: First, check the operational status via the API. If failures are found, **then** inspect the LookML definition to suggest fixes. Do NOT scan LookML files to find failures.
  ```bash
  looker-cli api datagroup all_datagroups | jq '.[] | select(.trigger_error != null) | {name: .name, model: .model_name, error: .trigger_error}'
  ```
- **Failed PDTs**:
  - **Workflow**: Check the **operational status** via System Activity first. Only inspect LookML definitions when specific failures are identified to suggest fixes (e.g., syntax errors in SQL).
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"pdt_event_log","fields":["pdt_event_log.count"],"filters":{"pdt_event_log.action":"%error%","pdt_event_log.created_date":"24 hours"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"pdt_event_log","fields":["pdt_event_log.view_name","pdt_event_log.model_name","pdt_event_log.action","pdt_event_log.error_reason","pdt_event_log.created_time"],"filters":{"pdt_event_log.action":"%error%","pdt_event_log.created_date":"24 hours"},"sorts":["pdt_event_log.created_time desc"]}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```

- **Cache Efficiency (Cache Hits vs Live Queries)**: Check the ratio of cache hits. Target > 50% for standard dashboards.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"history","fields":["history.result_source","history.query_run_count"],"pivots":["history.result_source"],"filters":{"history.result_source":"-NULL","history.created_date":"30 days"},"sorts":["history.result_source"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

### 4. User, Content, and Schedule Management
Audit the instance for inactive assets, orphaned schedules, and schedule hotspots using System Activity. Look for high-volume schedules (> 1/hr) or stale schedules (not run in 30 days).

- **Inactive Accounts (No Login in 90 Days)**:
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"user","fields":["user.count"],"filters":{"user_facts.last_ui_login_date":"before 90 days ago","user.is_disabled":"No"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"user","fields":["user.created_date","user.id","user.name","user_facts.last_ui_login_credential_type","user_facts.last_ui_login_date","history.most_recent_query_date"],"filters":{"user_facts.last_ui_login_date":"before 90 days ago","user.is_disabled":"No"},"sorts":["user.created_date desc"],"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


- **Inactive Content (Dashboards and Looks Not Queried in 60 Days)**:
  - **Audit Note**: If the title suggests it is an **Annual** or **Quarterly** report, flag this in the audit report so the reviewer can take it into account before deleting or archiving.
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"content_usage","fields":["content_usage.content_count"],"filters":{"content_usage.days_since_last_accessed":">=60","content_usage.dashboard_deleted":"No","content_usage.look_deleted":"No"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"content_usage","fields":["content_usage.content_id","content_usage.content_title","content_usage.content_type","content_usage.api_total","content_usage.embed_total","content_usage.favorites_total","content_usage.other_total","content_usage.schedule_total"],"filters":{"content_usage.days_since_last_accessed":">=60","content_usage.dashboard_deleted":"No","content_usage.look_deleted":"No"},"limit":"100"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


- **Draft/Test/Copy Content (Dashboards)**:
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.count"],"filters":{"dashboard.title":"%test%,%copy%,%draft%","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"dashboard","fields":["dashboard.id","dashboard.title"],"filters":{"dashboard.title":"%test%,%copy%,%draft%","dashboard.moved_to_trash":"No"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```

- **Draft/Test/Copy Content (Looks)**:
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"look","fields":["look.count"],"filters":{"look.title":"%test%,%copy%,%draft%","look.deleted_date":"NULL"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"look","fields":["look.id","look.title"],"filters":{"look.title":"%test%,%copy%,%draft%","look.deleted_date":"NULL"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


- **Schedule Hotspots (Peak Hours)**: Identify hours of the day with excessive scheduled jobs.
  ```bash
  echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_job.created_hour_of_day","scheduled_job.count"],"sorts":["scheduled_job.count desc"],"limit":"24"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
  ```

- **Failing Schedules**:
  - **Total Count of Failed Jobs**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_job.count"],"filters":{"scheduled_job.status":"failure"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_plan.id","scheduled_plan.name","scheduled_job.status","scheduled_job.status_detail"],"filters":{"scheduled_job.status":"failure"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


- **Orphaned Schedules (Owner is Disabled)**:
  - **Total Count**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_plan.count"],"filters":{"user.is_disabled":"Yes"}}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```
  - **Details**:
    ```bash
    echo '{"model":"system__activity","view":"scheduled_plan","fields":["scheduled_plan.id","scheduled_plan.name","user.name"],"filters":{"user.is_disabled":"Yes"},"limit":"50"}' | looker-cli api query run_inline_query json - | jq
    ```


> [!NOTE]
> **Definition-Based Analysis via CLI**: You can also use `looker-cli api scheduledplan all_scheduled_plans` to inspect schedule definitions directly. This is useful for analyzing `crontab` patterns to detect hotspots or checking `user_id` to identify potentially orphaned schedules (cross-reference with disabled users). However, to check **historical failures or execution history**, you MUST use the System Activity `scheduled_job` queries above.

## 📝 Reporting Guidelines & Bespoke Recommendations

When compiling the audit report, ensure that **Recommendations & Best Practices** is **NOT generic**. It must be bespoke to the findings and provide specific examples or snippet code, and direct link to dashboards/ folder/ lookml files where relevant.

- **Report Metadata**: At the top of the report, you **MUST** include key details:
  - **Timestamp**: The exact date and time when the audit was performed in a user-friendly format (e.g., `2026-07-09 5:30PM`).
  - **Looker Instance**: The URL of the Looker instance.
  - **Auditor**: The name of the agent and the model used (e.g., `Antigravity (Powered by Gemini 3.1 Flash)`).
- **Quantify Findings (CRITICAL)**: Do NOT use vague terms like "many" or "several". You **MUST** state the exact count of items found (e.g., "42 inactive accounts", "18 dashboards with 'test' in title").
- **Detail Schedule Hotspots**: When reporting schedule hotspots, specify the exact hour(s) and the volume of jobs (e.g., "Hotspot identified at **8:00 AM** with **150 scheduled jobs**").
- **Avoid Generic Statements**: Do not just say "Enforce Primary Keys". Instead, say "View `orders` in project `X` is missing a primary key. Add `primary_key: yes` to dimension `id`."
- **Provide Snippets**: Include code snippets demonstrating the fix.
- **Contextualize**: Link the recommendation to the specific metric or error found (e.g., "The explore `unoptimized_orders_simulation` is slow because of X. Optimize it by Y...").
- **Direct References (CRITICAL)**: You **MUST** generate explicit hyperlinks for all findings, recommendations, and LookML files mentioned in the report. Use the Looker instance URL base, file paths, and line numbers discovered during the audit to construct direct links to the Looker UI (e.g., `[users.view.lkml](https://<looker-instance>/projects/looker_mcp_demo/files/views/users.view.lkml#L10)` or `[Dashboard Performance](https://<looker-instance>/dashboards/14)`). If referring to System Activity Explores, provide the link to that explore. Do NOT just list file names or identifiers without links.

## 🛡️ Best Practices & Gotchas

- **Piping JSON**: Always use `echo '...' | looker-cli ... json -` to pass inline JSON to `run_inline_query`. Do NOT pass the JSON string directly as an argument, or you will get a "file name too long" error.
- **Filter Wildcards**: Use `%` (SQL style) instead of `*` for string filters in `run_inline_query` on System Activity (e.g., `%error%`).
- **Holistic Review**: You must analyze the instance or repositories as a whole to provide a holistic review.
- **Anti-Hallucination Guardrail**: NEVER hallucinate or assume data. Always run the query first and report only the actual results. If no data matches, report that explicitly.
